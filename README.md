# Dungeon

*Explore a large procedurally generated dungeon, grabbing and selling loot, fighting monsters, dodging traps and getting gold to buy items and spells in your attempt to kill the final boss. He rests behind the gold door, which requires the gold key to open, and the only noise you can make out from the inside are the faint sounds of rap music.*
*This game is intended to be a joke game. Save scum if you want, cheat if you care (H is the health value and G is gold), and use any exploits you find.*

The TI-84 Game made by myself. If you're low on Ram Storage use the app, otherwise you should try the programs. Programs run 30% faster than the app, not sure how to fix that, so I don't believe I can.
Be warned that it's 31 program files, so it will take up quite a bit of space, however they're almost all named "X(INSERT FILE NAME HERE)" so they will show up at the bottom of the program list, no need to sift through them just to find your homemade programs.

Simply use TI-Connect or a similar software and drag the files to your device. This was designed for the TI-84 PLUS, not the CE. It could possibly work on the CE but I've never tested it on one.

If you encounter a bug, it simply doesn't load, or the game sucks and you want to rant, just add a comment or whatever you do on github.
