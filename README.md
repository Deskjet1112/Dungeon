The TI-84 Game made by myself. If you're low on Ram Storage use the app, otherwise you should try the programs. Programs run 30% faster than the app.

Simply use TI-Connect or a similar software and drag the files to your device. This was designed for the TI-84 PLUS, not the CE. It could possibly work on the CE but I've never tested it on one.
